# Core Web vitals

## Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Key term**: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a stable Core Web Vital metric. It is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful.

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

**Key term**: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is an important, stable Core Web Vital metric for measuring perceived load speed because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded—a fast LCP helps reassure the user that the page is useful. 

## Interaction to Next Paint (INP) [Improvement on FID]

*FID is outdated now*

**Key term**: Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a stable Core Web Vital metric that assesses responsiveness using data from the Event Timing API. INP observes the latency of all interactions a user has made with the page, and reports a single value which all (or nearly all) interactions were beneath. A low INP means the page was consistently able to respond quickly to all—or the vast majority—of user interactions. 


Note: ***Meta** content is no longer taken seriously in ranking a page and stuff.*

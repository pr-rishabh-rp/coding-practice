# Cascading Style Sheets

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS is used to control the layout, formatting, and appearance of web pages. It allows developers to separate the content of a webpage from its design, making it easier to maintain and update.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

Here are some examples of CSS:

1. Changing the font color:
```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```

2. Setting the background color:
```css
body {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
}
```

3. Adding a border to an element:
```css
div {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

4. Adjusting the size of an image:
```css
img {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}
```

5. Applying a hover effect:
```css
a:hover {
    color: blue;
}
```

Remember to link your CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

VSCode usually offers a `link:css` shortcut for you to use.
